# What??

This project began as a Ninja Turtles search app but evolved into a "Hall of Heroes" inspired application that I've renamed "Room of Really Really Strong Dudes." It's a simple hero lookup tool leveraging a free online superhero API. The app is built with Angular 18, styled with Tailwind CSS, and utilizes Elf for state management. This project has been a fun way to experiment with new technologies and explore building user-friendly web applications.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Future Ideas

- overwrite existing theme with custom theme
- implement screen readers
